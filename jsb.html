                This is where I would put anything of substance if I were going to write it. I am not though so I'm going to bullshit my way through this post I don't know how long I can write this crap without losing my mind but here I am. I really hope nobody reads this.

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">A link</a><div> if I know about McDonald's, I know that I can go in there and get a meal that ancient kings could only dream about - bread, meat, pickled cucumbers, lettuce, cheese, onion, tomatoes, spices from around the world, fried potatoes, and a sweet beverage containing mood-elevating caffeine - for less than half an hour of my labor. even the mayonnaise on the sandwich requires people to brew vinegar, collect eggs, press oil, and harvest spices. the amount of work that goes into a big mac is staggering, and the fact that you could afford one even by just begging on the street for a few minutes is incredible.</div></li><br>
                <li><a href="#">A bird</a><div> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Veggietales. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of religion and ethical philosophy most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Larry’s optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Veggietales truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Bob's sign-off catchphrase “God made You special, and He loves You very much!” which itself is a cryptic reference to Plato’s Greek epic The Republic. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Phil Vischer’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.</div></li><br>

                <li><a href="#">Another link</a><div> And yes, by the way, i DO have a Veggietales tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid</div></li><br>
